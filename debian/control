Description: General Purpose Mouse interface
 This package provides a daemon that captures mouse events when the system
 console is active, and delivers events to applications through a library.
 .
 By default, the daemon provides a 'selection' mode, so that
 cut-and-paste with the mouse works on the console just as it does
 under X.
